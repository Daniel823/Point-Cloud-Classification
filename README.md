# Point-Cloud-Classification

**Problem Statement**: Often, LIDAR Data is difficult to understand visually. Creating a 3D point cloud can help Data Scientists 
and custumers understand the contents in a given dataset.

**Dataset**: [Ford Campus Vision and Laser Dataset](http://robots.engin.umich.edu/SoftwareData/Ford)

## Approach
1. Visualize LIDAR data using Matplot.lib
